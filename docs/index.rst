Acconeer documentation pages
============================

We are very happy that you have decided to have a closer look at what Acconeer's Pulsed Coherent Radar technology can offer.
On these documentation pages, you can find all the resources you need to explore your use case and integrate the sensor in your product.

To get started, the first thing you need is an evaluation kit.
Check out our |product_page| to see our current offer of sensors, modules, and evaluation kits.
A typical development flow to get started is to setup one of our evaluation kits and:

* Use our |reference_applications| to get guidance in your own application development
* Use one of our SDKs or Module Softwares to start software development, you find them on |developer_page|
