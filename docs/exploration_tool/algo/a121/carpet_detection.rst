Carpet detection
================

This innovation lab post will guide you through the process of defining, training and deploying a
surface classificaiton model, able to distinguish textile surfaces from hard floor.
The algorithm can be incorporated in any device that can benefit from knowing what type of
surface it is operating on, where the most obvious example is robotic vacuum cleaners.

The example code utilizes the Exploration Tool API to configure and collect data from the sensor.
The classification algorithm is implemented using Google's Tensorflow Keras API.
