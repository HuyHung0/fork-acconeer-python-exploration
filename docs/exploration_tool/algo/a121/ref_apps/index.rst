A121 Reference Applications
===========================

Get a head start in your evaluation and development by studying our Reference Applications.
See what parameters and algorithms we have used for specific use cases including how we have tested them and what the test results were.

Reference Applications are more specific than `Detectors <_a121_algorithms_detectors>`_ and is closer to a full implementation of a use case.

C implementations of Reference Applications are included in the `SDK <https://developer.acconeer.com/>`_ and is intended as a starting point for evaluation.
