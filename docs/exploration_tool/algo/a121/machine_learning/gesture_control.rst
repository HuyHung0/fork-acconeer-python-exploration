Gesture control
===============

This innovation lab post will guide you through the process of defining, training and deploying a
gesture classification algorithm, utilizing LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) machine learning
architecture, able to classify a number of hand gestures.

The example code utilizes the Exploration Tool API to configure and collect data from the sensor.
The classification algorithm is implemented using Google's Tensorflow Keras API.
