Common solutions gets the job done but are prone to bad user experience, waste of water and
constrained design.
Acconeer's solution improves on this by

- **Continuous detection of the hands:** Only run the water while hands are detected

- **Superior integration:** Due to the Acconeer radar's ability to see through some materials (See :ref:`tab_material`).
