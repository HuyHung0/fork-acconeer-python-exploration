Distance Measurement
####################

Distance measurements are a fundamental aspect of many fields and can enhance efficiency,
precision, and safety. Using sensors and connectivity, IoT-based systems provide real-time data for
industry, logistics, automation, and much more.

Acconeer Offering
=================

You can also see the offerings that measure distance in different ways:

- :doc:`/detectors/a121/distance_detection`: This :term:`Detector` offers pure distance measurements using the A121 sensor.

- :doc:`/example_apps/a121/phase_tracking`: An A121 Example Application for relative movement displacement.

- :doc:`/example_apps/a121/bilateration`: Example Application that measures distance and angle to and object using two A121 sensors.

- :doc:`/example_apps/a121/obstacle_detection`: A121 Example Application that measure distance and angle to objects using a single sensor in motion.

See also our related use cases:

- :doc:`tank_level`: Measure distance to liquid surface in a tank,

- :doc:`waste_level`: Measure distance to weak reflectors (waste),

- :doc:`presence`: Measure approximate distance of moving objects.
