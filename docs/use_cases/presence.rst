Presence detection refers to the ability to detect the presence or absence of people or moving objects within a certain area. This capability is essential in various applications, including smart home automation, security systems, energy management, and occupancy monitoring. Presence detection systems detect movement or changes in the environment, enabling responsive actions such as turning on lights, triggering alarms, or adjusting climate controls.
