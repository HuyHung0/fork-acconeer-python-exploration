Small Movement Tracking
#######################

In various advanced applications, the ability to detect and track very small movements, ranging from a few millimeters to even sub-millimeter precision, is crucial. Such precise movement tracking is essential in fields where subtle changes need to be monitored and analyzed accurately. Here are a few use cases where tracking very small movements is particularly valuable:

- **Health and Wellness Monitoring**: Detecting changes in breathing patterns or heartbeats can provide valuable insights into an individual's health status, aiding in the early detection of medical conditions.
- **Industrial Automation**: Monitoring the fine movements of machinery components helps in predictive maintenance and ensures the smooth operation of high-precision manufacturing processes.
- **Security Systems**: Detecting small vibrations or movements can enhance security systems by identifying unauthorized access or tampering attempts with high sensitivity.
- **Research and Development**: In scientific research, tracking tiny movements is essential for experiments that require precise measurement and control, such as in material testing or biological studies.

Acconeer Offering
=================

Acconeer's sensors are designed to deliver the high precision needed for these applications, using state-of-the-art :term:`PCR` technology to detect even the smallest movements reliably. To address these use cases we have created several :term:`Reference <Reference Application>` and :term:`Example Applications<Example Application>` that could be used as a reference on how to utilize the PCR technology:

- :doc:`Breathing Reference Application</ref_apps/a121/breathing>`: This Reference Application shows how the breathing rate of a stationary person can be estimated using the A121 sensor.
- :doc:`Vibration Example Application</example_apps/a121/vibration>`: This Example Application illustrates how the A121 sensor can be used to estimate the frequency content of a vibrating object, measured at a distance.
- :doc:`Phase Tracking Example Application</example_apps/a121/phase_tracking>`: This Example Application shows how a single object can be tracked using only the phase information of the A121 data.
